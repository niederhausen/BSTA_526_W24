Having her template made creating this website a much smoother process.\nThank you also to Andrew Bray for presenting the From R Markdown to Quarto ASA Travelling Workshop to the Oregon Chapter of the ASA in June 2023. This workshop was a great starting point in making the switch from RMarkdown to Quarto and also create Quarto webpages."

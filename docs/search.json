We encourage you to fill out as many surveys as possible to provide feedback on the class though.\nPlease fill out surveys by 8 pm on Sunday evenings to guarantee that they will be counted. We usually download them some time on Sunday evening or Monday. If you turn it in before we download the responses, it will get counted.\nThe questions on the survey are:\n\nRating the pace of the lecture and lab\nClearest Point: What point of the class was clearest for you?\nMuddiest Point: What point of class was the muddiest (unclear) for you?\nAnything Else: Anything else you’d like me to know?"

Thanks!\n\nI promise you can succeed in this class.\nLearning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2—made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail us, etc.\n\n\n\nAlison Horst Jan 3, 2020 tweet\n\n\n\n\n\nAlison Horst: Gator error"

Participants should refrain from seeking past published solutions to any assignments. Literature and resources (including internet resources and generative AI) employed in fulfilling assignments must be cited.\n\nSee Purdue University’s Online Writing Lab for resources on plagiarism and importantly avoiding plagiarism (thanks to Steve Bedrick for this link!).\nAssignments suspected of plagiarism (including copying past solutions or another student’s assignment) will receive 0 points for the assignment and the dean of the student’s academic program will be notified.\n\nIn an effort to uphold the principles and practice of academic honesty, faculty members at OHSU may use originality checking systems such as Turnitin to compare a student’s submitted work against multiple sources.\n\nTo protect student privacy in this process, it will be necessary to remove all personal information, i.e. student name, email address, student u-number, or any other personal information, from documents BEFORE submission.*\n\n\n\nUse of ChatGPT or other generative AI for assignments\nChatGPT and other generative AI tools can be great resources for learning how to code and/or troubleshoot code that does not work. However, the work you turn in must be your own. Thus it is inappropriate to directly ask AI to provide you with solutions to homework questions or write text that you are submitting in your assignment. If you do use AI tools to help you with an assignment, these must be cited along with how they were used.\nPlease see the Plagiarism & Attribution section (Code Snippets and AI Tools subsection) of Dr. Steve Bedrick’s BMI 525: Principles and Practice of DataVisualization webpage for examples of appropriate and inappropriate uses generative AI."

We will be closely following the same class materials.\nIdentifying which section of the code we were discussing during the lecture\n\nThanks for letting me know. I will try to be clearer in the future, and also jump around less. Please let me know in class if you’re not sure where we are at.\n\nThe material covered towards the end of the class felt a bit difficult to keep up with. I wish we would have been told to read the materials from Week 1 (or at least skim them) ahead of Day 1, because I quickly lost track of the conversation when shortcuts were used super quickly, for example, or when we jumped from chunks of code to another topic without reflecting on them. I still had 70% of the material down and I wrote great notes during the discussion (which I later filled in with the script that was on the class website), but I think it the beginner/intermediate programming lingo that was used to explain ideas here confused me at times. Thus, I struggled to keep up with discussions around packages / best coding practices, especially when they were not mentioned directly on the script (where I could follow along!).\n\nThanks for the feedback. In future years, we will reach out to students before the term to let them know about the readings to prepare for class. Please let us know if there is lingo we are using that you are not familiar with. Learning R and coding is a whole new language!\n\n\n\n\nRStudio\n\nI have trouble thinking through where things are automatically downloaded, saved, and running from. I can attend office hours for this!\n\nOffice hours are always a great idea. I do recommend paying close attention to where files are being saved when downloading and preferably specifying their location instead using the default location. Having organized files will make working on complex analyses much easier.\n\nHow to read the course material in R. While it made sense in real time it may be difficult when going back over the material.\n\nGetting used to reading code and navigating the rendered html files takes a while, and is a part of learning R. Figuring out how to take notes for yourself that works for you is also a learning curve. I recommend taking notes in the qmd files as we go through them in class. After class you can summarize and transfer key points to other file formats that you are more used to using. I personally have a folder in my Google drive filled with documents on different R programming topics. It started with one file, and then eventually expanded to multiple files on different topics in an attempt to organize my notes better. Whenever I learn something new (such as an R function or handy R package) that I want to keep for future reference, I add to them with links to relevant webpages and/or filenames and locations of where I used them.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nWhat does the pacman package do? I have it installed but I’m not sure what it is actually used for.\n\nI didn’t go into pacman in Day 1. The p_load() function from the pacman package (usually run as pacman::p_load()) lets you load many packages at once without separately using the library() function for each individually.\nAn added bonus is that by default it will install packages you don’t already have, unless you specify install = FALSE.\nAnother option is to set update = TRUE so that it will automatically update packages. I do not use this option though since sometimes updating packages causes conflicts with other packages or older code.\nYou can read more about the different options in the documentation. This Medium article also has some tips on using pacman.\n\nThe part on when to load in packages once they’ve already been loaded in - like for example would it be good to put that as a step in our homework 1 .qmd at the top? Or not necessary since they’re already loaded in to R Studio from the work we did in class yesterday? What would happen if we try to load them in and they were already loaded in, would the .qmd file not render and show an error?\n\nI always load my packages at the very top of the .qmd files, usually in the first code chunk (with the setup label). If you still have a previous R session open, then yes you don’t need to load the packages again to run code within RStudio. However, when a file is rendered it starts with an empty workspace, which is why our qmd file must include code that loads the packages (either using library() or pacman::p_load(). We don’t have to load packages at the beginning of the file, just before we have code that depends on the packages being used.\n\nI didn’t understand the part where we talked about num, char, logical combinations (line 503).\n\nThe content of the objects char_logical, num_char, num_logical, and tricky were designed specifically to be confusing and thus make us aware of how R will decide to assign the data type when a vector is a mix of data types. Some key takeaways are below. Let me know if you sitll have questions about this.\n\nNumbers and logical/boolean (TRUE, FALSE) do not have double quotes around them, but character strings do. If you add double quotes to a number or logical, then R will treat it as a character string.\nIf a vector is a mix of numbers and character strings, then the data type of the vector is character.\nIf a vector is a mix of numbers and logical, then the data type of the vector is numeric and the logical value is converted to a numeric value (TRUE=1, FALSE=0).\nIf a vector is a mix of character strings and logical, then the data type of the vector is character and the logical value is converted to a character string and no longer operates as a logical (i.e. no longer equal to 1 or 0).\n\n\nLines 614-619, confused what the ratio means there. Could you go over the correct code (or options of the correct code) for challenge 5?\n\nThe code 1:4 or 6:9 creates sequences of integers starting with the first specified digit and ending at the last specified digit. For example, 1:4 is the vector with the digits 1 2 3 4. You can also create decreasing sequences by making the first number the bigger one. For example, 9:7 is the vector 9 8 7.\nChallenge 5:\n\nmore_heights_complete &lt;- na.omit(more_heights)\nmedian(more_heights_complete)\nYou could also get the median of more_heights without first removing the missing values with median(more_heights, na.rm = TRUE).\n\n\nhow to count the TRUE values in a logical vector\n\nTRUE is equal to 1 in R (and FALSE is equal to 0), and the function sum() adds up the values in a vector. Thus, sum(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) is equal to 2. Similarly, sum(TRUE, FALSE, 5) is equal to 6.\nThe way I used it in class though is by counting how many values in the vector z (which was 7 9 11 13) are equal to 9. To do that I used the code sum(z == 9). Breaking that down, the code inside the parentheses z == 9 is equal to FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE since the == means “equals to” in R.\nYou can read up more on boolean and logical operators at the R-bloggers post."

We encourage you to fill out as many surveys as possible to provide feedback on the class though.\nPlease fill out surveys by 8 pm on Sunday evenings to guarantee that they will be counted. We usually download them some time on Sunday evening or Monday. If you turn it in before we download the responses, it will get counted.\nThe questions on the survey are:\n\nRating the pace of the lecture and lab\nClearest Point: What point of the class was clearest for you?\nMuddiest Point: What point of class was the muddiest (unclear) for you?\nAnything Else: Anything else you’d like me to know?"

Thanks!\n\nI promise you can succeed in this class.\nLearning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2—made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail us, etc.\n\n\n\nAlison Horst Jan 3, 2020 tweet\n\n\n\n\n\nAlison Horst: Gator error"

    "text": "Muddiest points\n\nClass logistics\n\nWill there be presentation slides in future classes, or is everything embedded into the quarto/html files for all lectures?\n\nThe material will primarily be in quarto/html files and not slides.\n\nSpecifics of what topics will be covered exactly. * I don’t have a list of all the specific functions we will be covering, but you are welcome to peruse the BSTA 504 webpage from Winter 2023 to get more details on topics we will be covering. We will be closely following the same class materials.\nIdentifying which section of the code we were discussing during the lecture\n\nThanks for letting me know. I will try to be clearer in the future, and also jump around less. Please let me know in class if you’re not sure where we are at.\n\nThe material covered towards the end of the class felt a bit difficult to keep up with. I wish we would have been told to read the materials from Week 1 (or at least skim them) ahead of Day 1, because I quickly lost track of the conversation when shortcuts were used super quickly, for example, or when we jumped from chunks of code to another topic without reflecting on them. I still had 70% of the material down and I wrote great notes during the discussion (which I later filled in with the script that was on the class website), but I think it the beginner/intermediate programming lingo that was used to explain ideas here confused me at times. Thus, I struggled to keep up with discussions around packages / best coding practices, especially when they were not mentioned directly on the script (where I could follow along!).\n\nThanks for the feedback. In future years, we will reach out to students before the term to let them know about the readings to prepare for class. Please let us know if there is lingo we are using that you are not familiar with. Learning R and coding is a whole new language!\n\n\n\n\nRStudio\n\nI have trouble thinking through where things are automatically downloaded, saved, and running from. I can attend office hours for this!\n\nOffice hours are always a great idea. I do recommend paying close attention to where files are being saved when downloading and preferably specifying their location instead using the default location. Having organized files will make working on complex analyses much easier.\n\nHow to read the course material in R. While it made sense in real time it may be difficult when going back over the material.\n\nGetting used to reading code and navigating the rendered html files takes a while, and is a part of learning R. Figuring out how to take notes for yourself that works for you is also a learning curve. I recommend taking notes in the qmd files as we go through them in class. After class you can summarize and transfer key points to other file formats that you are more used to using. I personally have a folder in my Google drive filled with documents on different R programming topics. It started with one file, and then eventually expanded to multiple files on different topics in an attempt to organize my notes better. Whenever I learn something new (such as an R function or handy R package) that I want to keep for future reference, I add to them with links to relevant webpages and/or filenames and locations of where I used them.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nWhat does the pacman package do? I have it installed but I’m not sure what it is actually used for.\n\nI didn’t go into pacman in Day 1. The p_load() function from the pacman package (usually run as pacman::p_load()) lets you load many packages at once without separately using the library() function for each individually.\nAn added bonus is that by default it will install packages you don’t already have, unless you specify install = FALSE.\nAnother option is to set update = TRUE so that it will automatically update packages. I do not use this option though since sometimes updating packages causes conflicts with other packages or older code.\nYou can read more about the different options in the documentation. This Medium article also has some tips on using pacman.\n\nThe part on when to load in packages once they’ve already been loaded in - like for example would it be good to put that as a step in our homework 1 .qmd at the top? Or not necessary since they’re already loaded in to R Studio from the work we did in class yesterday? What would happen if we try to load them in and they were already loaded in, would the .qmd file not render and show an error?\n\nI always load my packages at the very top of the .qmd files, usually in the first code chunk (with the setup label). If you still have a previous R session open, then yes you don’t need to load the packages again to run code within RStudio. However, when a file is rendered it starts with an empty workspace, which is why our qmd file must include code that loads the packages (either using library() or pacman::p_load(). We don’t have to load packages at the beginning of the file, just before we have code that depends on the packages being used.\n\nI didn’t understand the part where we talked about num, char, logical combinations (line 503).\n\nThe content of the objects char_logical, num_char, num_logical, and tricky were designed specifically to be confusing and thus make us aware of how R will decide to assign the data type when a vector is a mix of data types. Some key takeaways are below. Let me know if you sitll have questions about this.\n\nNumbers and logical/boolean (TRUE, FALSE) do not have double quotes around them, but character strings do. If you add double quotes to a number or logical, then R will treat it as a character string.\nIf a vector is a mix of numbers and character strings, then the data type of the vector is character.\nIf a vector is a mix of numbers and logical, then the data type of the vector is numeric and the logical value is converted to a numeric value (TRUE=1, FALSE=0).\nIf a vector is a mix of character strings and logical, then the data type of the vector is character and the logical value is converted to a character string and no longer operates as a logical (i.e. no longer equal to 1 or 0).\n\n\nLines 614-619, confused what the ratio means there. Could you go over the correct code (or options of the correct code) for challenge 5?\n\nThe code 1:4 or 6:9 creates sequences of integers starting with the first specified digit and ending at the last specified digit. For example, 1:4 is the vector with the digits 1 2 3 4. You can also create decreasing sequences by making the first number the bigger one. For example, 9:7 is the vector 9 8 7.\nChallenge 5:\n\nmore_heights_complete &lt;- na.omit(more_heights)\nmedian(more_heights_complete)\nYou could also get the median of more_heights without first removing the missing values with median(more_heights, na.rm = TRUE).\n\n\nhow to count the TRUE values in a logical vector\n\nTRUE is equal to 1 in R (and FALSE is equal to 0), and the function sum() adds up the values in a vector. Thus, sum(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) is equal to 2. Similarly, sum(TRUE, FALSE, 5) is equal to 6.\nThe way I used it in class though is by counting how many values in the vector z (which was 7 9 11 13) are equal to 9. To do that I used the code sum(z == 9). Breaking that down, the code inside the parentheses z == 9 is equal to FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE since the == means “equals to” in R.\nYou can read up more on boolean and logical operators at the R-bloggers post."

For now, you can take a look at an example I created for our BERD R workshops. The wide data in that example are not “tidy” since each cell contains two pieces of information: both the SBP and the visit number. In contrast, the long data have a separate column indicating which visit number the data in a given row are from.\n\nfor the “summary()” function, is there a way to summarize all but one variable in a dataset?\n\nYes! I sometimes restrict a dataset to a couple of variables for which I want to see the summary. I usually use the select() function for this, which we will be covering later in the course. For now, you can take a look at some select() examples from the BERD R workshops (see slides 29-32).\n\nDifferences between a tibble and a data.frame\n\nI’m not surprised to see this show up as a muddiest point!

    "text": "Muddiest points\n\nhere package\nThe here package takes a bit to explaining, but, compared to the old way of doing things, it is a real life saver. The issue in the past had to do with relative file paths, especially with .qmd files that are saved in sub-folders. The .qmd file recognizes where it is saved as the root file path, which is okay with a one-off .qmd file. But when working in projects (recommended) and striving for reproducible R code (highly recommended), the here package save a lot of headache.\nFor further reading: + Why should I use the here package when I’m already using projects? by Malcolm Barrett. + how to use the here package by Jenny Richmond. + here package vignette + Using here with rmarkdown\nProject-oriented workflows are recommended. Here package solves some old headaches. It gets easier with practice.\n\nQuestion about using here\n\n… how [here] can be used in certain instances where one may not remember if they switched to a new qmd file? In that case, would you suggest to use the “here” command each time you work on a project where there’s a chance that you’ll switch between qmd files and would like to use the same data file throughout? Is there any other way to better use this function or tips on how you deal with it?\n\nThere is a difference between working interactively in RStudio where data are loaded to the Environment. In this case, loading a data set once means that it can be used in any other code while working in the environment.\nIssues will com up when you go to render a .qmd that doesn’t have the data loaded within that .qmd. It won’t look to the environment for the data; it looks to the filepath that you specify in the .qmd. Best practice is to write the code to load the data in each .qmd or .R script so that R knows where to look for the data that you want it to operate on / analyze.\n\n\n\nThe ! function. It seems like sometimes we use ! and sometimes we use -. Are they interchangeable, or each with different types of functions?\n\n! – the exclamation point can be read as “not” it is primarily used in logical statements\n- – the minus sign can be used in more instances\n\nto do actual arithmetic (i.e. subtraction)\nto indicate a negative number\nwith dplyr::select() to remove or not select a column, or exclusion\n\n\n\n# Subtraction\n5 - 3\n\n[1] 2\n\n# Negation\nx &lt;- 10\n-x\n\n[1] -10\n\n# Selection/exclusion\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nselect(starwars, -height) |&gt; dplyr::glimpse()\n\nRows: 87\nColumns: 13\n$ name       &lt;chr&gt; \"Luke Skywalker\", \"C-3PO\", \"R2-D2\", \"Darth Vader\", \"Leia Or…\n$ mass       &lt;dbl&gt; 77.0, 75.0, 32.0, 136.0, 49.0, 120.0, 75.0, 32.0, 84.0, 77.…\n$ hair_color &lt;chr&gt; \"blond\", NA, NA, \"none\", \"brown\", \"brown, grey\", \"brown\", N…\n$ skin_color &lt;chr&gt; \"fair\", \"gold\", \"white, blue\", \"white\", \"light\", \"light\", \"…\n$ eye_color  &lt;chr&gt; \"blue\", \"yellow\", \"red\", \"yellow\", \"brown\", \"blue\", \"blue\",…\n$ birth_year &lt;dbl&gt; 19.0, 112.0, 33.0, 41.9, 19.0, 52.0, 47.0, NA, 24.0, 57.0, …\n$ sex        &lt;chr&gt; \"male\", \"none\", \"none\", \"male\", \"female\", \"male\", \"female\",…\n$ gender     &lt;chr&gt; \"masculine\", \"masculine\", \"masculine\", \"masculine\", \"femini…\n$ homeworld  &lt;chr&gt; \"Tatooine\", \"Tatooine\", \"Naboo\", \"Tatooine\", \"Alderaan\", \"T…\n$ species    &lt;chr&gt; \"Human\", \"Droid\", \"Droid\", \"Human\", \"Human\", \"Human\", \"Huma…\n$ films      &lt;list&gt; &lt;\"The Empire Strikes Back\", \"Revenge of the Sith\", \"Return…\n$ vehicles   &lt;list&gt; &lt;\"Snowspeeder\", \"Imperial Speeder Bike\"&gt;, &lt;&gt;, &lt;&gt;, &lt;&gt;, \"Imp…\n$ starships  &lt;list&gt; &lt;\"X-wing\", \"Imperial shuttle\"&gt;, &lt;&gt;, &lt;&gt;, \"TIE Advanced x1\",…\n\n\n\n\nUsing the fill command\nWe didn’t cover it in the lecture notes, but then it appeared in the example. I suggest to read/work through the fill vignette; the examples there are good ones to show what the function does. Then look back a the smoke_messy data set in Part 3 and think about why this command would be useful to clean up the data and for filling in missing values.\n\n\nLoading data into R\nIt gets easier and hopefully you get to see more example in the notes and practice with the homework. This tutorial is pretty good. So is the readxl vignette and the readr vignette.\n\n\nReasonable width, height, and dpi values when using ggsave\nThis takes some trial and error and depends on the purpose. For draft figures, dpi = 70 might be okay, but a journal might require dpi above 300 for publication. In Quarto, rendering an html, the figure defaults are 7x5 inches (Link). We talked about in class how you can use the plot panes to size your figures by trial and error.\n\n\nThe tidyselect section\nThere were pretty good resources in the notes\n\nSee some more examples in this slide\nFor more info and learning about tidyselect, please run this code in your console:\n\n\n# install remotes package\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\n# use remotes to install this package from github\nremotes::install_github(\"laderast/tidyowl\")\n\n# load tidyowl package\nlibrary(tidyowl)\n\n# interactive tutorial\ntidyowl::learn_tidyselect()\n\nHere is also a link with a list of the selectors and links to each one. For example, there is a link to starts_with and a bunch of examples."

Both themes and palettes contribute to visual appeal and readability of your plot.\n\nTheme:\n\n\nA theme in ggplot2 refers to the overall visual appearance of the plot. It includes elements such as fonts, colors, grid lines, background, and other visual attributes that define the look and feel of the entire plot.\nThemes are set using functions like theme_minimal(), theme_classic(), or custom themes created with the theme() function.

It is particularly relevant when working with categorical or discrete data where you want to distinguish between different groups.\nPalettes are set using functions like scale_fill_manual() or scale_color_manual(). You can specify a vector of colors or use pre-defined palettes from packages like RColorBrewer or viridis (we looked at the viridis package in class).\n\n\n# Example using a color palette\nggplot(data = smoke_complete, \n       aes(x = age_at_diagnosis, \n           y = cigarettes_per_day, \n           color = disease)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"red\", \n                                \"blue\", \n                                \"green\"))"

You are all still very new to R so be patient with yourself.\n\n\nHow to organize all of the material to understand the structure of how the R language works, rather than to keep track of all of the commands in an anecdotal way.\n\n\nAgain, I think that this gets better with experience. Though the R language, being open source, a lot of syntax is package dependent. So you need to be careful that some of the syntax we use with dplyr and the tidyverse will be different in base R or in other packages. This is something that comes with open source software (compared to Stata or SAS). The good news is that learning to use packages sets you up to better learn newer (to you) packages down the road."

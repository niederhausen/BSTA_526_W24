We encourage you to fill out as many surveys as possible to provide feedback on the class though.\nPlease fill out surveys by 8 pm on Sunday evenings to guarantee that they will be counted. We usually download them some time on Sunday evening or Monday. If you turn it in before we download the responses, it will get counted.\nThe questions on the survey are:\n\nRating the pace of the lecture and lab\nClearest Point: What point of the class was clearest for you?\nMuddiest Point: What point of class was the muddiest (unclear) for you?\nAnything Else: Anything else you’d like me to know?"

Thanks!\n\nI promise you can succeed in this class.\nLearning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2—made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail us, etc.\n\n\n\nAlison Horst Jan 3, 2020 tweet\n\n\n\n\n\nAlison Horst: Gator error"

    "text": "Academic Honesty\n\nCourse participants are expected to maintain academic honesty in their course work. Participants should refrain from seeking past published solutions to any assignments. Literature and resources (including internet resources and generative AI) employed in fulfilling assignments must be cited.\n\nSee Purdue University’s Online Writing Lab for resources on plagiarism and importantly avoiding plagiarism (thanks to Steve Bedrick for this link!).\nAssignments suspected of plagiarism (including copying past solutions or another student’s assignment) will receive 0 points for the assignment and the dean of the student’s academic program will be notified.\n\nIn an effort to uphold the principles and practice of academic honesty, faculty members at OHSU may use originality checking systems such as Turnitin to compare a student’s submitted work against multiple sources.\n\nTo protect student privacy in this process, it will be necessary to remove all personal information, i.e. student name, email address, student u-number, or any other personal information, from documents BEFORE submission.*\n\n\n\nUse of ChatGPT or other generative AI for assignments\nChatGPT and other generative AI tools can be great resources for learning how to code and/or troubleshoot code that does not work. However, the work you turn in must be your own. Thus it is inappropriate to directly ask AI to provide you with solutions to homework questions or write text that you are submitting in your assignment. If you do use AI tools to help you with an assignment, these must be cited along with how they were used.\nPlease see the Plagiarism & Attribution section (Code Snippets and AI Tools subsection) of Dr. Steve Bedrick’s BMI 525: Principles and Practice of DataVisualization webpage for examples of appropriate and inappropriate uses generative AI."

### Reminder to fill out post-class surveys

* This is a reminder that 5% of your grade is based on filling out [post-class surveys](https://ohsu.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5urkrdktEwkQqEu) as a way of telling us that you came to class and engaged with the material for that week.
* You only need to fill out 5 surveys (of the 10 class sessions) for the full 5%. We encourage you to fill out as many surveys as possible to provide feedback on the class though.
* __Please fill out surveys by 8 pm on Sunday evenings to guarantee that they will be counted.__ We usually download them some time on Sunday evening or Monday. If you turn it in before we download the responses, it will get counted.
